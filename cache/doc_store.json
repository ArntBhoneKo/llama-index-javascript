There are 27 different types of\\nqualifications depending on the activities and duration of stay in Japan.\\n1. Confirmation of Status of Residence\\nYour status of residence and duration of stay are dependent on the purpose of your entry to Japan. Check\\nthe type of status of residence and duration of stay specified in your passport. Note that you are forbidden\\nfrom engaging in activities other than those specified. Contact your local Immigration Bureaus for more\\ninformation.\\nSource: Brochure for Immigration Control, Immigration Bureau, Ministry of Justice\\n2. Resident Registration\\nAs of July 9th, 2012, we have introduced a new residency management system. Under the new system,\\nforeign nationals with a mid- to long-term stay in Japan are issued a resident card. There are some\\nexceptions, which include those entering Japan on diplomatic or official status, temporary visitors, and\\nThe seal indicates that you have\\nbeen permitted\\n(1) on June 1, 2009\\n(2) to stay for a short period of\\ntime in Japan for the\\npurpose of sightseeing,\\nbusiness or visiting relatives\\n(3) for the duration of 90 days\\n(4) and landed in Japan at\\nTerminal 2 of Narita\\nInternational Airport.\\nSeal of landing permission\\nThis new design has been\\nimplemented since June 1, 2008.\\nSeal of landing\\npermission\\n(old version)\\nSeal of landing\\npermission\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)(4) (4)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Ltrc6j1S4IcAcsz1Q7PC9hP3CsyU+ueQUPmlUs3i0FI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 5\\nthose staying for a period of less than 3 months.

The infants must file an application to obtain \\\"Status of Residence\\\" at a regional immigration office\\nwithin 30 days of the date of birth if the infant will be residing in Japan more than 60 days after the date of\\nbirth.\\nIn the Event of Emergency or Natural Disasters\\n1. Emergency\\nIf you are in need of an ambulance or involved in an emergency situation such as a fire, accident or\\nrobbery or other crimes, stay calm and call for help. The following emergency numbers are available,\\ndepending on the type of emergency. All lines are open 24 hours a day.\\nEmergency Numbers\\n* These numbers are only for emergency uses and are not intended for inquiries. Ambulance services\\nin Japan are free of charge. However, please refrain from requesting an ambulance if the case is\\nminor and can be dealt with your own vehicle or a taxi.\\n* Both 119 and 110 can be dialed from a land-line phone, public phone, cellular phone and PHS. It is\\nnot necessary to give the specific address if dialing from a public phone as they can automatically\\ntrace the source of the call.\\nHow to make an emergency call from a public phone\\nPick up the receiver, press the red emergency button and dial either 119 or 110. There is no need to insert\\ncoins or calling cards.\\n2. Natural Disasters\\nJapan is a country that is prone to earthquakes. It is also frequently hit by typhoons between summer and\\nfall. Therefore, it is very important to be always prepared for natural disasters so that in the event of a\\ndisaster, you can proceed without panicing and damage can be kept to a minimum. Knowing where to\\nevacuate in the event of an emergency is also essential.\\nAmbulance\\nDial 119\\n(fire department)\\nWhen you need an\\nambulance due to a sudden\\nillness or injury\\nFire\\nDial 119\\n(fire department)\\nCar accident\\nDial 110\\n(police station)\\nCrime\\nDial 110\\n(police station)\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"5KWnezFuV6YZC0FCcJJzDan1aHbhWfoJ+D77tKoHunc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 6\\n(1) Earthquakes\\nJapan is known for its frequency of earthquakes, which sometimes cause subsequent tsunamis. .\\nFire is the most common cause of collateral damage. After the shaking subsides, it is important to turn off\\nheat sources such as the gas stove and heater as soon as possible to prevent fire. Shut off the gas by\\nclosing the main valve and unplug all electric appliances. When evacuating, do so after switching off the\\ncircuit breaker. In case of a fire, let the neighbors know and work together to extinguish or control the fire\\nbefore the fire department arrives.\\n(2) Typhoons\\nTyphoons occur some time between July and October and are accompanied by heavy storms and rainfall.\\nThey can cause landslide as well as flooding.\\nHousing\\nIn Japan, there are three types of housing: private rental housing, publicly subsidized housing and\\nprivately owned housing.\\nIn the case of private rental housing and publicly subsidized housing, it is important to keep in mind that\\nyou cannot live with someone that is not your family without obtaining permission from the landlord. For\\nthis reason, if you expect to live in a friend’s house temporarily immediately after your arrival in Japan, it\\nis necessary to find your own place as early as possible.\\nIf you decide to rent a place in Japan, it is important to acquaint yourself with the customs and terms of\\nJapan’s rental system which include shikikin, reikin, koushin-ryo, etc. (explained below). Check with a real\\nstate agent.\\n1. Terms Used in Renting a Place\\n(1) Fudousan-ya (Real Estate Agent)\\nFudousan-ya is an agent that specializes in finding houses or apartments, deals with selling/buying or\\nreplacing houses, or acts as an intermediary to sell/buy or rent houses.\\n(2) Yachin (Rent)\\nYachin means rent and is paid every month. Unless you are moving in at the beginning of the month, the\\nrent will be pro-rated for the first month.\\n(3) Kanri-hi (Maintenance Charge) and Kyoueki-hi (Building Management Charge)\\nKanri-hi and kyoueki-hi are charges for the maintenance, electricity and general cleaning of the areas of\\nthe building (such as the stairs and hallways) that are shared by the renters. They are paid in addition to the\\nrent.\\n(4) Shikikin (Security Deposit)\\nShikikin refers to the security deposit that is paid to the landlord (owner of the house) upon entering into a\\nlease contract. It is usually equivalent to one to three months’ rent. If the rent is outstanding or the place is\\nleft damaged or in poor condition after the renter moves out, the money will be used to cover the cost and\\nwhatever left will be refunded to the renter.\\n(5) Reikin (Key Money)\\nReikin is the key money paid to the landlord as a gratuity. It is typically equivalent to one to two months of\\nrent and is non refundable. There are cases where reikin is not asked for.\\n(6) Chuukai Tesuu-ryo (Agent Fee)\\nChuukai tesuu-ryo is paid to the real estate agent as a finder’s fee. It is usually half or one month’s rent.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"eenaNBjc5H+N2jz39NJ9ApHM1aBy/tP/qBhArXKnhwY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":7,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 7\\n(7) Songai Hoken-ryo (Non-Life Insurance Premium)\\nThis refers to a non-life insurance premium for furniture and other items that you may be required to cover\\nupon entering into a contract.\\n(8) Koushin-ryo (Renewal Charge)\\nKoushin-ryo is the money paid to the landlord when renewing the contract. It is not always required.\\n(9) Rentai Hoshounin (Joint Surety (Guarantor))\\nYou are required to have a rentai hoshounin or a guarantor who is financially liable in case you cannot\\nafford rent or pay for necessary repairs. It is usually an individual who has a certain level of income;\\nhowever, you can also use a guarantor company (hoshougaisha). Also, depending on where you live, the\\nmunicipality may offer a guarantor system (hoshouseido). For more details, consult the municipal office or\\na real estate agent.\\n2. Private Rental Housing\\nIf you decide to rent private rental housing, consult a real estate agent. It is important to know what you\\nare looking for in terms of rent, size and other conditions. Note that typically you will need money\\nequivalent to five to six months’ rent to enter into a lease contract.\\n(1) How to Look for a Place\\nVisit a real estate agent in the neighborhood to which you are planning to move. Tell them what kind of\\nplace you are looking for, such as in terms of rent, size and proximity to the station so they can find you a\\nplace.\\nYou can also check the flyers posted on the storefront, or browse magazines and the Internet to get a price\\nrange and find available places in the area you plan to move to. Overseas students can go to the student\\naffairs office of the university to search for information.\\n(2) How to Rent a Place\\nYou will enter into a contract when renting a house or an apartment. This contract is called a lease contract.\\nThe term of the contract is generally two years.\\nThe following documents and fees are required for the contract.\\nDocuments required for the contract Fees required for the contract\\n1. Resident Card\\n2. Certificate of earnings\\n3. Joint Surety (Guarantor) or covenant\\n4. Personal Seal Registration, etc.\\n1. First and next month’s rent\\n2. Shikikin (security deposit)\\n3. Reikin (key money)\\n4. Chuukai Tesuu-ryo (Agent fee), etc.\\nIf you add all the fees involved in renting a\\nplace, the total will be equivalent to 5 to 6\\nmonths’ rent.\\n(3) What to Keep in Mind When Renting\\n(a) Bathtubs\\nIf the place does not have a bath, you can take a bath at a public bathing facility called a sento, for a\\nnominal charge.\\n(b) Renovations and Remodeling\\nKeep in mind that you cannot renovate or remodel the place or let someone other than your family move\\nin with you without obtaining the permission from the landlord. Needless to say, you are not allowed to\\nsublease the whole or any part of the place.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"1PlMUnepafUvGCELXg3zVGs7+u/XdoqLNaU0vaN5AsU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":8,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 8\\nDrive a nail or paint the wall Sublease the place\\n(4) Few Tips on Renting\\nWhen renting housing, you may encounter a few impediments. Here are some tips that you may find\\nuseful. Keep in mind that your local International Association may be able to help you as well.\\nCannot speak Japanese: Go to the real estate agent with someone who can speak Japanese. Even just a\\nsimple greeting will give the agent a good impression .\\nCannot find a guarantor: You can also use a guarantor company if you cannot find an individual.\\nConsult the real estate agent. Another option is to check with your local municipal office to see if they\\noffer a guarantor system.\\nCannot rent a place because you are a foreigner: Go on the Internet or ask around to see if your friends\\nor acquaintances know of any real estate agents that are more eager to help foreigners to find a place. If\\nyou feel like you have been discriminated against because you are from another country, you can\\nconsult some of the Human Rights Counseling Offices mentioned later.\\n3. Publicly Subsidized Housing\\nPublic housing consists of housing offered by local public entities (such as prefectures and municipalities)\\nand public-service corporations (such as Urban Renaissance Agency that manages UR rental housing).\\nBoth will require specific conditions for foreign tenants such as being registered as a resident and\\nsatisfying certain income standards. For more information, contact the local municipality or the Urban\\nRenaissance Agency that manages the public housing in which you are interested.\\n4. Applying for Electricity, Gas and Water\\nAfter you have found a new place and entered into a lease contract, you will need to connect utilities so\\nyou can get situated. Make sure you apply for electricity, gas and water before you move in. Procedures\\nmay vary depending on the area. The general guideline is as follows.\\nElectricity Gas Water\\nWhen?

Resident Registration\\nAs of July 9, 2012, foreign nationals who have newly entered Japan, and have been staying as mid- to\\nlong-term residents are requested to register their residential address at the local municipal office. This\\nshould be done within 14 days after they have decided their residence. It is necessary to show a resident\\ncard (or passport if the resident card will be obtained later) when applying for registration of residential\\naddress. In cases where the householder is a mid- to long-term status foreign resident, original documents\\n(along with Japanese translation) of marriage certificate, birth certificate, or other documents certifying\\nthe relationship with the members of the household must be provided.\\n6. Vacating\\nMake sure you clarify the necessary procedures for vacating when you enter into a lease contract. It is not\\nuncommon to run into problems due to renter’s misunderstanding or not following the required\\nprocedures.\\n(1) Notification to Cancel the Lease Contract\\nIf you are living in rental housing, you are required to give the landlord the notification that you would\\nlike to cancel the lease contract one or two months in advance. Details on the necessary procedures are\\nspecified in the lease agreement. (You may have to notify the landlord in writing.)\\n(2) Necessary Procedures before Moving\\nRemember to notify the utility companies (electric, gas, water and phone), post office, financial\\ninstitutions and thecity hallof the address change.

Medical Care\\nWhen receiving medical treatment in Japan, it is best to bring someone who can speak Japanese since\\nmany medical facilities do not offer services in foreign languages. Also, this may be important in order to\\naccurately communicate the symptoms you have. Some prefectures post information regarding medical\\nfacilities and their capacity in foreign languages on their website so it is recommended to check whether\\nthe staff at your local hospital or clinic can speak your native language.\\nThere are two types of medical facilities in Japan: hospitals that are fully equipped for in-patient care and\\ncomplete examinations and clinics that specialize in family practice.\\nIt is advised to go see a doctor at a local clinic first and then receive specialized treatment at a larger\\nhospital if necessary. Do some research on the medical facilities in your area to be prepared in case of an\\nemergency. You may find the website of your prefecture helpful to gather some information.\\nAlso, it is important to visit the municipal office or look through ethnic media guides to consciously look\\nfor information regarding medical treatment, such as flu vaccinations, offered locally.\\n(1) Finding a Medical Facility\\nYou can find a medical facility by looking through public relations magazines published by municipalities,\\nsearching on the Internet or looking in a phone book.

Also, if you are currently taking any medication, bring it with you on your visit.\\n2. Insurance\\nIf you live in Japan, you are required to have some form of public health insurance. There are two types of\\nhealth insurance in Japan: Employees Health Insurance (kenko hoken) offered to employees working at\\ncompanies and factories and National Health Insurance (kokumin kenko hoken) for self-employed or\\nunemployed people.\\nIf you are enrolled in public health insurance, you are generally required to pay only 30% of the medical\\nexpenses which are standardized throughout the country. However, if you do not have public health\\ninsurance, you will end up paying a considerable amount of money since you are responsible for paying\\nall the expenses.\\n(1) Treatment Not Covered by Insurance\\nAlthough as a general rule public health insurance will cover 70% of the total medical expenses, it is\\nimportant to know that there are treatments that are not covered by insurance.\\n(Treatment not covered by insurance)\\nNormal pregnancy and childbirth\\nAbortion performed for non-medical reasons\\nHealth check-up and complete physical examination (Some municipalities may partially cover the\\nexpenses.)\\nImmunization\\nPlastic surgery and orthodontics\\nInjuries or accidents that occurred on the way to work or at work (This will be reimbursed by workers’\\ncompensation insurance (rousai hoken).)\\nAn additional charge for a bed, for example when staying in a private room at the hospital\\nExaminations, surgeries, treatments and drugs not covered by health insurance\\n(2) Public Health Insurance\\n(a) Employees’ Health Insurance (Kenko Hoken)\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"/Kvg7D4euIj8VDXx/LAbTE+jSVsAt7QfXlIy5m4G7/4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_12":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 12\\nSince Employees’ Health Insurance is processed by the company you work for, check with your employer\\nregarding the enrollment procedures.

The premium amount is dependent on a\\nfew factors such as your salary. Your employer pays half of the premium and you pay the other half.\\n(b) National Health Insurance (Kokumin Kenko Hoken)\\nIf you are a registered alien qualified to stay in Japan and are not enrolled in your company’s employee’s\\nhealth insurance scheme, you must enroll in National Health Insurance. In addition, if the duration of stay\\nwas set to less than three months at the time of entry and you have been allowed to extend your stay in\\nJapan to over three months, you will be required to join the National Health Insurance(This does not apply\\nto those who are staying in Japan for only a short period of time.).\\nYou will need to file the paperwork at the National Health Insurance Division of the local municipality at\\nwhich you completed your alien registration. Once you enroll in the National Health Insurance, you will\\nremain enrolled unless you file the appropriate paperwork. If the beneficiary’s status changes for such\\nreasons as the beneficiary having enrolled in Employee’s Health Insurance, a child is born or the\\nbeneficiary is deceased, it must be reported to the municipal office within 14 days. The same applies in\\ncase you lose or damage your insurance card.\\nChange of address must be reported accordingly as well. If you are moving, go to your local municipal\\noffice to notify the date you are moving. Once you move to a new place, report the address change to the\\nmunicipal office in your new neighborhood within 14 days.\\nIf you are leaving Japan, you will be required to bring documents such as your insurance card, seal (if you\\nhave one), Certificate of Alien Registration and your plane ticket and file the necessary paperwork (unless\\nyou are leaving the country temporarily).\\nYou yourself will be required to pay the premium. You can pay at the bank or a municipal office by\\nbringing the notification of payment sent by the municipality with you or you can make a deposit via a\\nbank transfer from your bank account. There are cases where a public official makes a home visit to\\ncollect the premium.\\nThe premium amount varies among municipalities and is determined on the basis of factors such as the\\nincome level and number of people in the household. If you have lived in Japan for less than a year, and\\nthus you received no income in Japan in the previous year, the premium for the first year will be the\\nminimum level and it will change according to your income from the following year. In addition, if you\\nare 40 or over and less than 65 years of age, you will be required to pay the premium for nursing insurance\\n(kaigo hoken) as well.\\n3. Pension (Nenkin)\\nPublic pension is part of the social security system that provides with a pension to the elderly, disabled and\\nbereaved. It provides financial support for the person concerned during old ege, disablement or\\nbereavement.\\n(1) Enrollment in National Pension Plan (Kokumin Nenkin)\\nIf you live in Japan and are 20 years of age or over and less than 60 years of age, you are required to enroll\\nin the National Pension Plan regardless of your nationality.

However, if you are enrolled in Employees’ Pension Insurance, it is not necessary to file the\\napplication for the National Pension Plan as you will automatically be enrolled.\\n(b) Payment of the Premium\\nRegardless of the income level, the premium is 14,980 yen for each month (as of fiscal year 2012). You\\nwill receive the notification of payment from Japan Pension Service for the whole year in April. You can\\neither pay at a post office, bank or convenience store using the notification of payment or pay via a bank\\ntransfer.\\nIf it is difficult to pay the premiums for reasons such as your income level is not sufficient, you may be\\nentitled to waive the premium in full or partially. Also, if you are a student, apply for the Special Pension\\nPayment Exemption for Students (which may not be available at certain schools) to postpone the payment.\\nIf you are qualified for exemption of the premiums (except for those who have obtained legal exemption),\\nas a general rule you must file the appropriate paperwork every year. Talk to the staff at the pension plan\\ndepartment for more details.\\n(2) Enrollment in Employees’ Pension Insurance (Kousei Nenkin Hoken)\\n(a) Eligibility for Enrollment\\nJust like Employees’ Health Insurance, employers are required to provide their full-time employees with\\nEmployees’ Pension Plan if they are a company or factory that has more than five employees or if they are\\na corporation (regardless of their size). Also, if you are a part-time worker and your work hours and work\\ndays account for three quarters or more of the weekly work hours of regular workers, you are also obliged\\nto enter the insurance scheme.\\n(b) Enrollment Procedures\\nApplication for the Employees’ Pension Plan is filed at the company you work for. Ask your employer or\\nthe pension office for more details.\\n(c) Payment of the Premium\\nThe employer and employee split the payment obligations on a fifty-fifty basis. The premium amount is\\ndependent on the employee’s monthly salary and bonus and is paid through the employer. Ask your\\nemployer or the pension plan office for more details.\\nEducation\\nIn general, education in Japan consists of three years in kindergarten, six years in elementary school, three\\nyears in junior high school, three years in high school and four years in university (two years in junior\\ncollege). The nine-year education in elementary and junior high schools, from 6 to 15 years old, is\\nmandatory in Japan.\\nOn the basis of stipulations in the International Covenants on Human Rights, non-Japanese children\\nbetween ages 6 and 15 are entitled to receive an education at a public school. They are not only accepted\\nfree of charge but are provided with necessary extra lessons and activities that help them learn Japanese\\nand adopt to regular classroom settings. Just like their Japanese counterparts, foreign students can attend\\nor transfer to local elementary schools and junior high schools without paying any tuition. It is important\\nto consult the municipal office regarding your child’s education for the sake of his or her future. Schools\\nthat have a high ratio of non-Japanese students have teachers and instructors in charge of teaching\\nJapanese.\\nEducation prior to elementary school is provided at kindergartens. There are also vocational schools where\\njunior high or high school graduates can pursue to acquire specialized skills and techniques. There are also\\nschools for disabled children.\\nVirtually all students in Japan go on to high school after they graduate from junior high.

There is also a\\nqualification test system that provide the opportunity to enroll at a high school for those who were not able\\nto graduate from junior high school. Also, depending on the area, there may be international schools for\\nchildren with foreign nationality.\\nEmployment\\nIf you are a foreigner qualified to live and work in Japan, Public Employment Service Centers (also\\nknown as Hello Work) is a good place to visit for support in order to improve your employment status and\\nin the event you become unemployed.

If you have any concerns or problems\\nregarding your labor conditions, you can consult the Labor Standards Office. Many Labor Bureaus and\\nLabor Standards Offices offer consultation for foreign workers.\\n1. Employment Contract (Roudou Keiyaku)\\nAn employment contract is a contract concluded between you and your employer when you start working\\nfor the employer. When a contract is concluded, the empoyer is supposed to execute a written document\\nthat specifies the wages (salary), work hours and other binding labor-related terms and conditions. It is\\nprovided by the employer upon entering into an agreement with the employee.\\nIt is important to have the terms and conditions of employment in writing since it is not uncommon to run\\ninto trouble; for instance, because the amount of salary has only been agreed verbally, in reality the\\namount of salary was not payed as previously agreed.\\nIf the contract is written in Japanese, make sure you fully understand the content by having it translated\\ninto your native language or otherwise, if necessary.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"1lmg3fv4RSNLIsVsGatr6LLOh7N8f+GKY1KlgGiXLsQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 15\\n2.

For example, if an\\nemployee injures his/herself at work or becomes sick, it is unlawful to terminate the contract during the\\nperiod of recuperation or within 30 days of coming back to work. The same applies to when an employee\\ntakes a maternity leave; the employer may not lay her off during the leave or within 30 days after\\nreturning to work.\\nIf the duration of the contract has never been specified and the employer terminates the employment\\ncontract, it would be deemed wrongful and invalid, arising out of the abuse of power by the employer,\\nunless the contract was terminated for legitimate reasons that were socially justifiable. For employment\\ncontracts of which the duration has been specified, unless there is a compelling reason for termination,\\nlaying off an employee for the duration of his/her contract is unlawful. In addition, employers are required\\nto give employees a 30-day notice upon termination or pay employees dismissal allowance equivalent to\\nthe employees’ average daily wages for 30 days or more.\\nLife in the Neighborhood\\n1. Greetings to Your New Neighbors\\nIn Japan, it is customary to visit your neighbors to introduce yourself when you have moved to a new\\nplace. This is important because you can become acquainted with people that live in your area and they\\nmay also be a good source of information. Give them a general self-introduction such as your name and\\nwhat you do for living.\\n2. Neighborhood Association (Chonai Kai) and Residents’ Association (Jichi Kai)\\nIn general, municipalities have some form of community organizations called chonai kai (neighborhood\\nassociation) and jichi kai (residents’ association). These associations bring neighbors together by having\\nthem participate in neighborhood crime watch, conduct emergency drills and organize festivals. You may\\nalso receive kairanban, which is a circulated newsboard that contains notification from local offices or the\\npublic health department, and you will be required to pass it on to your next door neighbor. The activities\\nare funded by fees collected from the residents in the neighborhood. Foreign citizens can also join as long\\nas they are residents. It is a good source for obtaining local information. Ask your neighbors about\\nassociations in your area.\\n3.

(Gomi means garbage.)\\n* Incombusible garbage has generally been defined as garbage that emits poisonous gas when burned or\\nraises the temperature in the incinerator so high that it can cause the incinerator to break down.\\nHowever, note that the definition may differ according to the area you live in.\\n* Even though it is technically combustible, some areas may categorize certain items as incombustible\\naccording to the way they dispose of them.\\n* It is important to keep in mind that sorting is not truly based on whether the garbage physically burns\\nor not but more so on whether it is combustible or incombustible or if it is recyclable according to the\\nrules in the area.\\nIllegal Dumping\\nGarbage that has been put out in an improper manner will not be collected. Leaving garbage in\\nnon-designated places (dumping or fuhou touki) is against the law and is subject to punishment. In\\naddition to causing a nuisance to neighbors, dumping negatively affects the environment. Therefore, never\\nengage in illegal dumping.\\n4.

It is best not to jaywalk or cross the street when the light is red.\\nIf you are a pedestrian, you should only cross the street where there are crosswalks.

Banks\\nJapanese tend to deposit extra money on hand into the bank or in the post office savings bank and\\nwithdraw cash as needed. Most people do not keep money in draws at home or carry around a large\\namount of cash. For Japanese people, it makes more sense to keep money in the bank for security reasons\\nand for the sake of earning interests.\\nWhen opening a new savings account at the bank, you are simply required to bring the cash and your\\nCertificate of Alien Registration and fill out a designated form with your name, address and signature. You\\nwill receive a savings passbook which records your transactions to help you manage your money.\\nIn addition, it is useful to create an ATM card (called cash card in Japan) when opening a savings account\\nat the bank. You will be required to register a 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) for the card.\\nThis card allows you to instantly withdraw or deposit money into your account through an ATM at any\\nbranches of the bank. You can withdraw money at any bank with an ATM card. You can also withdraw a\\nlimited amount of money instantly through ATMs installed throughout downtowns of towns and cities.\\nAlthough very convenient, ATM cards are not very secure against fraudulent use. It is important to keep\\nthe PIN to yourself since anyone can freely withdraw money from your account if they get a hold of your\\ncard and your PIN. If you lose your card, you need to contact your bank as soon as possible.\\n2. Post Offices\\nThe symbol of post offices and mail boxes in Japan is a capital letter T with a bar over it (〒). In addition\\nto offering postal services such as parcels, printed matter, express mail and telegrams (also known as\\nLetax), post offices handles banking and insurance. You can open an account at the post office just like\\nyou would at a bank. Having a postal savings account allows you to send money transfers within Japan or\\nto other countries, make deposits and pay utilities. You can easily set it up so that it enables account\\ntransfers for utilities and taxes the same as at a bank and the procedures are also the same as at banks.\\nPost offices are open on weekdays from 9 am to 5 pm. (Some offices may be open on the weekends and\\nlate at night.) Banking and insurance services are handled from 9 am to 4 pm, Monday through Friday.\\nWebsite of Japan Post Services http://www.post.japanpost.jp/index.html (Japanese)\\nhttp://www.post.japanpost.jp/english/index.html (English)\\nIf you move and notify the post office of the change in address, mail sent to the old address will be\\nautomatically forwarded to the new address for one year.\\nOthers\\n1. Restrooms\\nThere are two styles of toilets in Japan. One is a squat toilet, which is known as washiki or Japanese-style\\ntoilet set horizontally into the floor and you face the hemispherical hood; another is the Western-style\\nflush toilet, which is called youshiki. Most public places have both styles of toilet.\\nRestrooms at restaurants and private houses sometimes have a pair of slippers you can wear inside the\\nfacilities. Do not forget to take them off when you leave. Public restrooms may not always have toilet\\npaper; women may want to carry some tissue paper just in case.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"PJZmbI9abKnNhWM6Tkvw/3WlAOWeeHnGGYxoNL2moyQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_20":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_20\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":20,\"total_pages\":23,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\GitHubFiles\\\\NEX4AI\\\\llama-index-javascript\\\\data\\\\guide_living_en.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"guide_living_en.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page | 20\\n2.

trouble-free.The following covers some of the very basic information you will find useful in starting a new life in\\nJapan.Rights and Obligations of Foreign Residents in Japan\\nThe Constitution of Japan guarantees to equally entitle the fundamental human rights to foreigners who\\nreside in Japan unless such rights only apply to Japanese citizens by their nature.Japan has concluded principal human rights treaties such as the International Covenants on Human Rights\\n(the International Covenant on Economic, Social and cultural Rights and the International Covenant on\\nCivil and Policical Rights), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\\nDiscrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Convention on the Elimination of All\\nForms of Discrimination against Women.Also, regardless of nationality, all residents in Japan are required to pay national taxes (such as income tax,\\nsales tax, etc.) and local taxes (such as residence tax, etc.).Status of Residence\\nIn order for you to reside in Japan, you will need a status of residence.There are 27 different types of\\nqualifications depending on the activities and duration of stay in Japan.1.Confirmation of Status of Residence\\nYour status of residence and duration of stay are dependent on the purpose of your entry to Japan.Check\\nthe type of status of residence and duration of stay specified in your passport.Note that you are forbidden\\nfrom engaging in activities other than those specified.Contact your local Immigration Bureaus for more\\ninformation.Source: Brochure for Immigration Control, Immigration Bureau, Ministry of Justice\\n2.Resident Registration\\nAs of July 9th, 2012, we have introduced a new residency management system.Under the new system,\\nforeign nationals with a mid- to long-term stay in Japan are issued a resident

is important to turn off\\nheat sources such as the gas stove and heater as soon as possible to prevent fire.Shut off the gas by\\nclosing the main valve and unplug all electric appliances.When evacuating, do so after switching off the\\ncircuit breaker.In case of a fire, let the neighbors know and work together to extinguish or control the fire\\nbefore the fire department arrives.(2) Typhoons\\nTyphoons occur some time between July and October and are accompanied by heavy storms and rainfall.They can cause landslide as well as flooding.Housing\\nIn Japan, there are three types of housing: private rental housing, publicly subsidized housing and\\nprivately owned housing.In the case of private rental housing and publicly subsidized housing, it is important to keep in mind

that case, it is best for you to familiarize yourself with the content.3.Termination of Employment\\nThere are laws and regulations that prevent wrongful temination of employment.For example, if an\\nemployee injures his/herself at work or becomes sick, it is unlawful to terminate the contract during the\\nperiod of recuperation or within 30 days of coming back to work.The same applies to when an employee\\ntakes a maternity leave; the employer may not lay her off during the leave or within 30 days after\\nreturning to work.If the duration of the contract has never been specified and the employer terminates the employment\\ncontract, it would be deemed wrongful and invalid, arising out of the abuse of power by the employer,\\nunless the contract was terminated for legitimate reasons that were socially justifiable.For employment\\ncontracts of which the duration has been specified, unless there is a compelling reason for termination,\\nlaying off an employee for the duration of his/her contract is unlawful.In addition, employers are required\\nto give employees a 30-day notice upon termination or pay employees dismissal allowance equivalent to\\nthe employees’ average daily wages for 30 days or more.Life in the Neighborhood\\n1.Greetings to Your New Neighbors\\nIn Japan, it is customary to visit your neighbors to introduce yourself when you have moved to a new\\nplace.This is important because you can become acquainted with people that live in your area and they\\nmay also be a good source of information.Give them a general self-introduction such as your name and\\nwhat you do for

renting\\nan apartment in Japan requires you to state your Japanese bank account) you\\ncan opt to input a temporary residence address that you can change once you\\nfinalize your long-term address in Japan.Depending on your visa, you should\\nbe able to receive support for housing from the company or university that\\nsponsors you.In the case that you are on a working holiday visa or any short-\\nterm residence status, share houses can be an option as their short contract\\nterm periods mainly accommodate short-term working holiday users.Some\\nshare houses also allow for a credit card payment that doesn’t require the\\naccount to be under a Japanese bank.If you reside in Tokyo, you can check\\nour foreigner-friendly guide on finding an apartment for more
