trouble-free.The following covers some of the very basic information you will find useful in starting a new life in\nJapan.Rights and Obligations of Foreign Residents in Japan\nThe Constitution of Japan guarantees to equally entitle the fundamental human rights to foreigners who\nreside in Japan unless such rights only apply to Japanese citizens by their nature.Japan has concluded principal human rights treaties such as the International Covenants on Human Rights\n(the International Covenant on Economic, Social and cultural Rights and the International Covenant on\nCivil and Policical Rights), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\nDiscrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women.Also, regardless of nationality, all residents in Japan are required to pay national taxes (such as income tax,\nsales tax, etc.) and local taxes (such as residence tax, etc.).Status of Residence\nIn order for you to reside in Japan, you will need a status of residence.There are 27 different types of\nqualifications depending on the activities and duration of stay in Japan.1.Confirmation of Status of Residence\nYour status of residence and duration of stay are dependent on the purpose of your entry to Japan.Check\nthe type of status of residence and duration of stay specified in your passport.Note that you are forbidden\nfrom engaging in activities other than those specified.Contact your local Immigration Bureaus for more\ninformation.Source: Brochure for Immigration Control, Immigration Bureau, Ministry of Justice\n2.Resident Registration\nAs of July 9th, 2012, we have introduced a new residency management system.Under the new system,\nforeign nationals with a mid- to long-term stay in Japan are issued a resident card.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"72HGnWTA2qiYlVMnAkjwTY865WAmBCpB53N9HpbYXeg="},"01a1af7e-33c2-43c5-bc09-0f0d1d055bc1":{"id_":"01a1af7e-33c2-43c5-bc09-0f0d1d055bc1","metadata":{"page_number":4,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Ltrc6j1S4IcAcsz1Q7PC9hP3CsyU+ueQUPmlUs3i0FI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fb501d70-f7b8-49cc-88a1-d9999ba449ee","metadata":{"page_number":4,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"72HGnWTA2qiYlVMnAkjwTY865WAmBCpB53N9HpbYXeg="}},"text":"There

important to turn off\nheat sources such as the gas stove and heater as soon as possible to prevent fire.Shut off the gas by\nclosing the main valve and unplug all electric appliances.When evacuating, do so after switching off the\ncircuit breaker.In case of a fire, let the neighbors know and work together to extinguish or control the fire\nbefore the fire department arrives.(2) Typhoons\nTyphoons occur some time between July and October and are accompanied by heavy storms and rainfall.They can cause landslide as well as flooding.Housing\nIn Japan, there are three types of housing: private rental housing, publicly subsidized housing and\nprivately owned housing.In the case of private rental housing and publicly subsidized housing, it is important to keep in mind that\nyou cannot live with someone that is not your family without obtaining permission from the landlord.For\nthis reason, if you expect to live in a friend’s house temporarily immediately after your arrival in Japan, it\nis necessary to find your own place as early as possible.If you decide to rent a place in Japan, it is important to acquaint yourself with the customs and terms of\nJapan’s rental system which include shikikin, reikin, koushin-ryo, etc. (explained below).Check with a real\nstate agent.1.Terms Used in Renting a Place\n(1) Fudousan-ya (Real Estate Agent)\nFudousan-ya is an agent that specializes in finding houses or apartments, deals with selling/buying or\nreplacing houses, or acts as an intermediary to sell/buy or rent houses.(2) Yachin (Rent)\nYachin means rent and is paid

Here are some tips that you may find\nuseful. Keep in mind that your local International Association may be able to help you as well.\nCannot speak Japanese: Go to the real estate agent with someone who can speak Japanese. Even just a\nsimple greeting will give the agent a good impression .\nCannot find a guarantor: You can also use a guarantor company if you cannot find an individual.\nConsult the real estate agent. Another option is to check with your local municipal office to see if they\noffer a guarantor system.\nCannot rent a place because you are a foreigner: Go on the Internet or ask around to see if your friends\nor acquaintances know of any real estate agents that are more eager to help foreigners to find a place. If\nyou feel like you have been discriminated against because you are from another country, you can\nconsult some of the Human Rights Counseling Offices mentioned later.\n3. Publicly Subsidized Housing\nPublic housing consists of housing offered by local public entities (such as prefectures and municipalities)\nand public-service corporations (such as Urban Renaissance Agency that manages UR rental housing).\nBoth will require specific conditions for foreign tenants such as being registered as a resident and\nsatisfying certain income standards. For more information, contact the local municipality or the Urban\nRenaissance Agency that manages the public housing in which you are interested.\n4. Applying for Electricity, Gas and Water\nAfter you have found a new place and entered into a lease contract, you will need to connect utilities so\nyou can get situated. Make sure you apply for electricity, gas and water before you move in. Procedures\nmay vary depending on the area. The general guideline is as follows.\nElectricity Gas Water\nWhen?

in foreign languages on their website so it is recommended to check whether\nthe staff at your local hospital or clinic can speak your native language.There are two types of medical facilities in Japan: hospitals that are fully equipped for in-patient care and\ncomplete examinations and clinics that specialize in family practice.It is advised to go see a doctor at a local clinic first and then receive specialized treatment at a larger\nhospital if necessary.Do some research on the medical facilities in your area to be prepared in case of an\nemergency.You may find the website of your prefecture helpful to gather some information.Also, it is important to visit the municipal office or look through ethnic media guides to consciously look\nfor information regarding medical treatment, such as flu vaccinations, offered locally.(1) Finding a Medical Facility\nYou can find a medical facility by looking through public relations magazines published by municipalities,\nsearching on the Internet or looking in a phone book.Your neighbors probably will be a good source as\nwell.There are also following organizations that offer phone consultations in foreign languages.NPO Corporation

Nihongo Gakko, which are Japanese language\nschools, and courses and classes offered by others. Nihongo Gakko is not free of charge; Japanese classes\nand courses offered by others are either free or relatively inexpensive. Some municipalities, International\nAssociations, non-governmental organizations and volunteer groups also offer Japanese classes and\ncourses for free or at a nominal fee, making the learning experience more accessible to foreigners. In\naddition, local community centers and civic centers utilize empty classrooms to offer various courses such\nas those targeting children, those for children and parents and those for adults. For more details, contact\nInternational Associations, prefectural and city governments or municipal offices.\nOn the other hand, to help your child maintain his/her mother tongue, you can contact a network that uses\nyour language or an international school. Gathering some information regarding Japan through\nnewspapers and magazines written in your native language may also be helpful.\nTaxes\nIf you live in Japan and earn a certain level of income, you are obligated to pay taxes regardless of your\nnationality.\nThere are two types of taxes in Japan: national taxes and local taxes. National taxes are taxes imposed by\nthe national government and one of the most important are income taxes. Local taxes are taxes applied by\nthe prefectural or municipal authorities and include residence taxes and automobile taxes.

walk on the right side of the road.If you are on a bicycle, you need to stay on the left side,\nmaking sure you are not in the way of cars.Traffic signals are strictly enforced in Japan.Cars cannot move on a red light even if there are no other\ncars coming from the right and left side.However, if the light is green, oftentimes cars will come blazing\ndown the road on full speed.It is best not to jaywalk or cross the street when the light is red.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7aP/VS0Qlebk6ZPZIGVLm+fHMUTlbNghfUQ2l+LUYag="},"9c9c1735-66dd-44d8-a691-dbb4ac06306b":{"id_":"9c9c1735-66dd-44d8-a691-dbb4ac06306b","metadata":{"page_number":18,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"d7eJ872HBsU1V54QlZO1xmV4OnAg1bmmjsn61/RQR3E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a6f66b19-2b5d-449e-b00e-dca885ce3b86","metadata":{"page_number":18,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"7aP/VS0Qlebk6ZPZIGVLm+fHMUTlbNghfUQ2l+LUYag="}},"text":"It

at home or carry around a large\namount of cash.For Japanese people, it makes more sense to keep money in the bank for security reasons\nand for the sake of earning interests.When opening a new savings account at the bank, you are simply required to bring the cash and your\nCertificate of Alien Registration and fill out a designated form with your name, address and signature.You\nwill receive a savings passbook which records your transactions to help you manage your money.In addition, it is useful to create an ATM card (called cash card in Japan) when opening a savings account\nat the bank.You will be required to register a 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) for the card.This card allows you to instantly withdraw or deposit money into your account through an ATM at any\nbranches of the bank.You can withdraw money at any bank with an ATM card.You can also withdraw a\nlimited amount of money instantly through ATMs installed throughout downtowns of towns and cities.Although very convenient, ATM cards are not very secure against fraudulent use.It is important to keep\nthe PIN to yourself since anyone can freely withdraw money from your account if they get a hold of your\ncard and your PIN.If you lose your card, you need to contact your bank as soon as possible.2.Post Offices\nThe symbol of post offices and mail boxes in Japan is a capital letter T with a bar over it (〒).In addition\nto offering postal services such as parcels, printed matter, express mail and telegrams (also known as\nLetax), post offices handles banking and insurance.You can open an account at the post office just like\nyou would at a bank.Having a postal savings account allows you to send money transfers within Japan or\nto other countries, make deposits and pay utilities.You can easily set it up so that it enables account\ntransfers for utilities and taxes the same as at a bank and the procedures are also the same as at banks.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EipPyI4HgRnBcC11SymIBqdin37HkdVDbTUvqlZDaZ0="},"e2ee438a-6e88-42f0-98e5-0f8b8599d49c":{"id_":"e2ee438a-6e88-42f0-98e5-0f8b8599d49c","metadata":{"page_number":19,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/guide_living_en.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"PJZmbI9abKnNhWM6Tkvw/3WlAOWeeHnGGYxoNL2moyQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"166a047a-849f-451b-87c6-f1cefc26bbac","metadata":{"page_number":19,"total_pages":23,"file_path":"C:\\GitHubFiles\\NEX4AI\\llama-index-javascript\\data\\guide_living_en.pdf","file_name":"guide_living_en.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"EipPyI4HgRnBcC11SymIBqdin37HkdVDbTUvqlZDaZ0="}},"text":"Post
